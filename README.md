FRC® Notebook is an app intended for FRC volunteers to keep notes on the teams competing though the entire competition. Notes you make on a team for one match show up in the rest of their matches as reminders. Perfect for keeping track of what happened to teams during each of their matches and having it all organized nicely for you.

FRC Notebook is open source - feel free to [pull request](https://github.com/plnyyanks/frc-notebook). And please, report any bugs/feature requests to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/plnyyanks/frc-notebook/issues)
